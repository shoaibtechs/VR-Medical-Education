\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this chapter we have defined which features can be implement in Future.
\section{Conclusion:}
Our $metaverse$ project's basic capabilities, such as injection procedures, patient records, and medication records, have been effectively built throughout its first development. The foundation for a strong, engaging, and extremely useful virtual healthcare environment is laid by these fundamental instruments. But in order for this $metaverse$ healthcare system to reach its full potential, a few things need to be improved and developed further.
\section{Future Work:}
Future research will focus on advanced clinical simulations, real-time feedback, and virtual diagnostic tools like blood tests, CT, and MRI scans. Emergency training scenarios will incorporate time-sensitive decision-making and multi-user cooperation. AI-driven virtual consultations, comprehensive patient histories, and secure communication will enhance patient interaction. Therapeutic environments will offer interactive modules for education, rehabilitation, and mental health therapy. Key priorities include interoperability with healthcare systems, IoT device integration, and blockchain for secure records. Educational resources will expand through interactive modules, virtual dissection labs, and online CME in the metaverse. User experience will be improved with a user-friendly interface, multilingual support, cultural adaptations, and accessibility features.
